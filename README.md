# Assignment problem
This repository provides a solution to the assignment problem using the simplex method in [**C++**](https://github.com/ivandybko/Assignment_problem/tree/efeb10e38d894c580ebc6824da78ffdc703ea97a/Source%20code/C%2B%2B) and [**MATLAB**](https://github.com/ivandybko/Assignment_problem/tree/efeb10e38d894c580ebc6824da78ffdc703ea97a/Source%20code/MATLAB). In addition, for comparison, a well-known solution using the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhnâ€“Munkres algorithm) has been added. A description of the implemented algorithms has also been added in [**documentation**](https://github.com/ivandybko/Assignment_problem/blob/03807dd529f6f3370d10e6979b2f6e2e95912046/Documentation%20(in%20Russian).pdf).
