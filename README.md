# Assignment problem
This repository provides a solution to the assignment problem using the simplex method in ([**C++**](https://github.com/ivandybko/Assignment_problem/tree/efeb10e38d894c580ebc6824da78ffdc703ea97a/Source%20code/C%2B%2B)) and MATLAB. In addition, for comparison, a well-known solution using the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhnâ€“Munkres algorithm) has been added. A description of the implemented algorithms has also been added in [**documentation**](/Documentation (in Russian).pdf).
